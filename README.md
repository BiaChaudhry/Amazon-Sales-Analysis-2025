## 🚀 Project Overview
This project dives deep into **Amazon Sales Data (2025)** to discover insights about product performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends.  
It also builds a **Linear Regression model** to forecast **next month’s total sales**, offering a practical example of applied **data science in business**.

---

## 🧾 Dataset Summary
The dataset contains **250 rows × 11 columns** with attributes such as:
- 🏷️ Product & Category  
- 💰 Total Sales & Quantity  
- 💳 Payment Method  
- 📅 Order Date & Status  
- 🧾 Discount & Price

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
Here’s what the EDA reveals:

| Visualization | Purpose |
|---------------|----------|
| 📦 Total Sales by Category | Identify high-revenue product categories |
| 📈 Quantity Sold by Category | Track product demand |
| 🏆 Top 10 Products by Sales | Highlight best-performing items |
| 💰 Sales Distribution | Understand overall revenue spread |
| 💳 Sales by Payment Method | Discover popular payment types |
| 📅 Monthly Sales Trend | Spot seasonality and growth patterns |
| 🔄 Order Status Breakdown | Show cancelled vs. delivered orders |

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning: Sales Forecasting
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Goal:** Predict total sales for the upcoming month  
- **Libraries:** `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- 📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- 📈 Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- 🎯 R² Score  

**Result:** The model predicts next month’s sales trend based on historical monthly performance.  
A red marker on the chart shows the forecasted sales value.

## 💡 Key Insights
- 🛍️ Certain product categories dominate total sales revenue.  
- 💸 Discounts negatively impact profit margins.  
- 💳 COD (Cash on Delivery) and UPI are most common payment methods.  
- 🗓️ Seasonal peaks indicate potential for time-based marketing campaigns.  

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements
- 🔮 Build time-series forecasting models (ARIMA / Prophet).  
- 📊 Add profit margin and customer churn prediction.  
- 🌐 Create a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive exploration.  
- 💼 Automate data pipeline for real-time business analytics.
